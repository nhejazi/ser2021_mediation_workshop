# Stochastic Direct and Indirect Effects {#stochastic}

## Definition of the effects

Consider the following directed acyclic graph.

\end{figure}

## Motivation for stochastic interventions

- So far we have discussed effects for binary exposures
- Controlled direct effects and natural effects require that $0 < \P(A=1\mid W) < 1$
