## Motivation for stochastic interventions

- So far we have discussed controlled, natural, and interventional (in)direct effects
- These effects require that $0 < \P(A=1\mid W) < 1$
- They are defined only for binary exposures
-  _What can we do when the positivity assumption does not hold or the exposure
  is continuous?_
- Solution: we can use stochastic effects

## Definition of stochastic effects

There are two possible ways of defining stochastic effects:

- Consider the effect of an intervention where the exposure is drawn from a
  distribution
  - For example incremental propensity score interventions
- Consider the effect of an intervention where the post-intervention exposure is
  a function of the actually received exposure
  - For example modified treatment policies
- In both cases $A\mid W$ is non-deterministic post-intervention, thus the name _stochastic intervention_

### Example: incremental propensity score interventions (IPSI) [@kennedy2018nonparametric] {-}

#### Definition of the intervention {-}

- Assume $A$ is binary, and $\P(A=1\mid W=w) = g(1\mid w)$ is the propensity score
- Consider an intervention in which each individual receives the intervention
  with probability $g_\delta(1\mid w)$, equal to
  \begin{equation*}
    g_\delta(1\mid w)=\frac{\delta g(1\mid w)}{\delta g(1\mid w) +
    1 - g(1\mid w)}
  \end{equation*}
- e.g., draw the post-intervention exposure from a Bernoulli variable with
  probability $g_\delta(1\mid w)$
- The value $\delta$ is user given
- Let $A_\delta$ denote the post-intervention distribution
- Some algebra shows that $\delta$ is an odds ratio comparing the pre- and
  post-intervantion distributions
  \begin{equation*}
    \delta = \frac{\text{odds}(A_\delta = 1\mid W=w)}
    {\text{odds}(A = 1\mid W=w)}
  \end{equation*}
- Interpretation: _what would happen in a
  world where the odds of receiving treatment is increased by $\delta$_
- Let $Y_{A_\delta}$ denote the outcome in this hypothetical world

#### Illustrative application for IPSIs

- Consider the effect of participation in sports on children's BMI
- Mediation through snacking, exercising, etc.
- Intervention: for each individual, increase the odds of participating in a
  sports by $\delta=2$
- The post-intervention exposure is a draw $A_\delta$ from a Bernoulli
  distribution with probability $g_\delta(1\mid w)$

### Example: modified treatment policies (MTP) [@diaz2020causal] {-}

#### Definition of the intervention {-}

- Consider a continuous exposure $A$ taking values in the real numbers
- Consider an intervention that assigns exposure as $A_\delta = A - \delta$
- Example: $A$ is pollution measured as $PM_{2.5}$ and you are interested in an
  intervention that reduces $PM_{2.5}$ concentration by some amount $\delta$

### Mediation analysis for stochastic interventions

- The total effect of an IPSI can be computed as a contrast of the outcome under
  intervention vs no intervention:
  \begin{equation*}
    \psi = \E[Y_{A_\delta} - Y]
  \end{equation*}
- Recall the NPSEM
  \begin{align}
    W & = f_W(U_W)\\
    A & = f_A(W, U_A)\\
    M & = f_M(W, A, U_M)\\
    Y & = f_Y(W, A, M, U_Y)
  \end{align}
- From this we have
\begin{align*}
M_{A_\delta} & = f_M(W, A_\delta, U_M)\\
Y_{A_\delta} & = f_Y(W, A_\delta, M_{A_\delta}, U_Y)
\end{align*}

- Thus, we have $Y_{A_\delta} = Y_{A_\delta, M_{A_\delta}}$ and $Y = Y_{A,M_{A}}$
- Let us introduce the counterfactual $Y_{A_\delta, M}$, interpreted as the
  outcome observed in a world where the intervention on $A$ is performed but the
  mediator is fixed at the value it would have taken under no intervention:
  \[Y_{A_\delta, M}  = f_Y(W, A_\delta, M_{A_\delta}, U_Y)\]
- Then we can decompose the total effect into:
  \begin{align*}
    \E[Y&_{A_\delta,M_{A_\delta}} - Y_{A,M_A}] = \\
    &\underbrace{\E[Y_{\color{red}{A_\delta},\color{blue}{M_{A_\delta}}} -
      Y_{\color{red}{A_\delta},\color{blue}{M}}]}_{\text{stochastic natural indirect effect}} +
      \underbrace{\E[Y_{\color{blue}{A_\delta},\color{red}{M}} -
      Y_{\color{blue}{A},\color{red}{M}}]}_{\text{stochastic natural direct effect}}
  \end{align*}

## Identification assumptions

- Confounder assumptions:
  + $A \indep Y_{a,m} \mid W$
  + $M \indep Y_{a,m} \mid W, A$
- No confounder of $M\rightarrow Y$ affected by $A$
- Positivity assumptions:
  + If $g_\delta(a \mid w)>0$ then $g(a \mid w)>0$
  + If $\P(Z=z\mid W=w)>0$ then $\P(Z=z\mid A=a,W=w)>0$

Under these assumptions, stochastic effects are identified as follows

- The indirect effect can be identified as follows
\begin{align*}
\E&(Y_{A_\delta} - Y_{A_\delta, M}) =\\
&\E\left[\color{Goldenrod}{\sum_{a}\color{ForestGreen}{\{\E(Y\mid A=a, W)-\E(Y\mid A=a, M, W)\}}g_\delta(a\mid W)}\right]
\end{align*}

- The direct effect can be identified as follows
\begin{align*}
\E&(Y_{A_\delta} - Y_{A_\delta, M}) =\\
&\E\left[\color{Goldenrod}{\sum_{a}\color{ForestGreen}{\{\E(Y\mid A=a, M, W) - Y\}}g_\delta(a\mid W)}\right]
\end{align*}

- Let's dissect the formula for the indirect effect in R:
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
n <- 1e6
w <- rnorm(n)
a <- rbinom(n, 1, plogis(1 + w))
m <- rnorm(n, w + a)
y <- rnorm(n, w + a + m)
```

- First, fit regressions of the outcome on $(A,W)$ and $(M,A,W)$:
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
fit_y1 <- lm(y ~ m + a + w)
fit_y2 <- lm(y ~ a + w)
```

- Get predictions fixing $A=a$ for all possible values $a$
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
pred_y1_a1 <- predict(fit_y1, newdata = data.frame(a = 1, m, w))
pred_y1_a0 <- predict(fit_y1, newdata = data.frame(a = 0, m, w))
pred_y2_a1 <- predict(fit_y2, newdata = data.frame(a = 1, w))
pred_y2_a0 <- predict(fit_y2, newdata = data.frame(a = 0, w))
```
- Compute
\[\color{ForestGreen}{\{\E(Y\mid A=a, W)-\E(Y\mid A=a, M, W)\}}\]
for each value $a$
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
pseudo_a1 <- pred_y2_a1 - pred_y1_a1
pseudo_a0 <- pred_y2_a0 - pred_y1_a0
```

- Estimate the propensity score $g(1\mid w)$ and evaluate the post-intervention
  propensity score $g_\delta(1\mid w)$
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
pscore_fit <- glm(a ~ w, family = binomial())
pscore <- predict(pscore_fit, type = 'response')
## How do the intervention vs observed propensity score compare
pscore_delta <- 2 * pscore / (2 * pscore + 1 - pscore)
plot(pscore, pscore_delta, xlab = 'Observed prop. score',
     ylab = 'Prop. score under intervention')
abline(0, 1)
## What are the odds of exposure under intervention vs real world?
odds <- (pscore_delta / (1 - pscore_delta)) / (pscore / (1 - pscore))
summary(odds)
```

- Compute the sum
\[\color{Goldenrod}{\sum_{a}\color{ForestGreen}{\{\E(Y\mid A=a, W)-\E(Y\mid A=a, M, W)\}}g_\delta(a\mid W)}\]

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
indirect <- pseudo_a1 * pscore_delta + pseudo_a0 * (1 - pscore_delta)
```

- The average of this value is the indirect effect
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
## E[Y(Adelta) - Y(Adelta, M)]
mean(indirect)
```

- The direct effect is
\begin{align*}
\E&(Y_{A_\delta} - Y_{A_\delta, M}) =\\
&\E\left[\color{Goldenrod}{\sum_{a}\color{ForestGreen}{\{\E(Y\mid A=a, M, W) - Y\}}g_\delta(a\mid W)}\right]
\end{align*}

- Which can be computed as
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
direct <- (pred_y1_a1 - y) * pscore_delta +
       (pred_y1_a0 - y) * (1 - pscore_delta)
mean(direct)
```

## Summary

- Stochastic (in)direct effects
  - Relax the positivity assumption
  - Can be defined for non-binary exposures
  - Do not require a cross-world assumption

- Still require the abscence of intermediate confounders
  - But, compared to the NDE and NIE, we can design a randomized study where
    identifiability assumptions hold, at least in principle
  - There is a version of these effects that can accomodate intermediate
    confounders [@hejazi2020nonparametric]
  - `R` implementation to be released soon, stay tuned!

<!--
ID: Should I add: continuous interventions, and/or the definitions of effects with intermediate confounders?
KER: I don't think adding for intermediate confounders is necessary. Continuous interventions would be really useful *if* practical methods existed for that, but I think despite the paper existing, it hasn't really been done in practice, right? So probably wouldn't want to get into that.
