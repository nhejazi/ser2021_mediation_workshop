# Estimating natural, interventional, and stochastic effects using R packages

We are interested in assessing the population intervention direct effect and
the population intervention indirect effect, based on the effect decomposition
of the population intervention effect introduced in @diaz2020causal.

To proceed, we'll use as our running example a simple data set from an
observational study of the relationship between BMI and kids behavior,
distributed as part of the [`mma` R package on
CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mma). First, let's load the packages
we'll be using and set a seed; then, load this data set and take a quick look
at it
